# love2D-pongGame
a Wip Pong Game made with Love2D using LUA to learn and practise 2D Math Logic.


## Description of the project.
I'm currently working on a simple pong game made with LUA and love2d.
After completing this project, I plan to move on to creating a brick game.
The purpose of working on these projects is to gain a deeper understanding of 2D math logic, including collision handling, distance calculations, sprite positions, player and AI movements, velocity, and overall game logic. 

In summary,

this project is a pong game clone where the player needs to hit the ball into the opponent's field to score points and update their score.
